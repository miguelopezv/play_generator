# Text Generator

Creates text based on Shakespeare or any other text you want to.

## How to use it

if this is the first time you run it, verify that lines 40-45 are commented.

- run ```python main.py```, it will ask you to leave the input empy if you want to use the dafault training dataset (
  Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet)
  or choose your own file (spported formats txt and rtf).

- let the model runt it's training, if it's taking too long you can change the number of epochs on the `constants.py`
  file

- After the training is done, run again ```python main.py``` but this time comment line 32-38 and uncomment lines 40-45.

- the prompt will ask you to enter a string and will create a new output based on that, in the style of the text you
  povided as training.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰




> **_NOTE:_**  If you want to train the model with a different text then you should rename or
> delete `training_checkpoints` folder, uncomment line 32-38 and comment lines 40-45, and do the previous steps again.
